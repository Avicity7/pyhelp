## Welcome to **pyhelp**!

This repository aims to help you with the basics of Python. We hope that this repository is able to make you grasp the concepts of Python much more easier and better!

### Following The Repository
If you'd like to follow along the repository, there will be two files for most concepts â€” a **Python** file (.py) and a **Markdown** file (.md). 

If you'd like to explore the concept, check out the Markdown files. Else, if you'd like to explore the syntax, check out the Python file instead.

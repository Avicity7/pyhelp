### What is Python?

Python is a [high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) that is extremely versatile; many of today's technology is powered by Python since it's simple to get started with and yet extremely powerful at the same time.

If you're interested in the world of programming, Python serves to be a great introductory language for you to get started on. With great support almost everywhere and useful packages to suit different needs, you can use and transform Python to almost anything you'd like it to be.

### How do I install Python?

There are many ways to install and set up Python on your computer. We'll discuss the most direct method, installing the package from the official Python website. If you are more advanced, you may look for alternative methods.

#### Installing the Package from the Website

This is the easiest and most user-friendly option to install the Python language. Included with this is:

- **IDLE**, a simple and beginner-friendly [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
- **The Python language**

Let's begin!

1. Visit the [Python website](https://python.org) (https://python.org)
2. Hover or click on the Downloads tab.
    - If hovering, you can choose to download the latest package for your operating system directly.
    - If clicked, you can choose to download the latest package for your operating system and also check out previous releases of Python.
3. Choose a version (optional) and download the package.
4. Run the package executable to install Python to your device.

> **Note!**
>
> Even though Python is installed in your system after running the package executable, it cannot be accessed directly through Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows). Instead, you'll need to configure and set Python up; the process here may differ across operating systems.

Once you're all good to go, you should be able to see IDLE. Run it and let's get started with Python!
